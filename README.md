DebugTools for ESP8266/Arduino.

This is a collection of miscellaneous bits of code I have been using to
debug issues with the ESP8266 and the Arduino IDE.

Some parts of the code may mot work, or may not work well, or partly written.
It is provided as-is, with little documentation other than what comments are
in the source, and I provide no support.

Particular features/tests are mostly contained in their own file, with
DebugTools.ino tying them together / providing examples of use.

See config.h to turn on/off various tests and settings.
Update credentials.h with your wifi network details.
